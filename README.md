 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Anton's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey started with the start of master program in Quant Finance @Kiel University. The program is divided into mathematical finance, statistics and econometrics courses. We started using Python in MF to determine and visualize several models to estimate option prices. We applied e.g. MonteCarlo-Simulations or Cox-Ross-Rubenstein approaches for similar outcomes as the common Black-Scholes-Model. Furthermore, we developed algorithms for the Heston model, distinguished between European, American and Exotic Options and discussed hedging opportunities. Our statistic journey has been divided into Probability Calculus & Inferential Statistics. We used R-Studio to discover the advantages and disadvantages of basic probaility theory, parametric families and asymptotic theory. Our professor preferred simulations, e.g. MonteCarlo and bootstrapping methods, to explore the world of statistics. The second part was all about estimations and testing concepts. The third column of this program considered basic methods in econometrics, e.g. OLS, instrumental variables, M-estimation, MLE or GMM. For our home assignment we used STATA to prove hypothesis.
 During my exchange semester I expanded my knowledge of Python by learning with DataCamp & Udemy, and beyond that I entered the world of SQL.
